# Sales-project
This is a sales dataset from a popular American brand ADIDAS which covered the  year 2020 and 2021. The data contains information about 9563 transactions done within this period. It contains 13 columns having dates, numbers and text datatypes.  The dataset was an Excel file downloaded from Kaggle.
# Data Tools
The data was cleaned and manipulated to accommodate only columns relevant to the analysis, Excel was used for both data manipulation and visualization.
# Documentation
The questions I created visualizations to answer are the following:
The retailers and the value of their transactions?
What products were sold and what are the values?
What was the number of transactions done by each retailer?
What was the regional outlook on sales?
what quarter delivered the most revenue?
What channel is the most profitable?
# Insights
The total value of transactions is $ 899,902,125.00. West Gear had the highest revenue ($242m) while the retailer with highest count of transactions (2637) was Footlocker. The 2 companies had all 3-sales channel running from the beginning of the data collection while others had 1 channel missing at some point within the period so this could likely be the reason, they are tops.

Men’s street footwear generated the most sales ($208m) and profit followed by Women’s apparel ($179m).
The top 5 performers of the states were New York, California, Florida, Texas and South Carolina respectively, it is interesting to note that Florida though in third place in total sales was in second place in terms of profit.

Out of the 5 regions represented, the West $269,943,182 and Northeast $186,324,067 were tops. Northeast used all sales channels fairly equally but significant revenue and profit came from  in-store and outlet transactions. In the west, online and outlet were their dominant channel but revenue and profit drivers were In-store and outlet channels. In the south, outlets and online channels drove revenue, counts of transactions and profit. The south did very little transaction In-store. The mid-west all 3 channels were engaged In-store generated the most value though online had the highest number of transactions. It is still the lowest revenue region. In the southeast online and In-store drove transaction count, revenue and profit, outlets had very poor performance here.

The region with the best cumulative profit was the South with 43% followed by Midwest 38% while Northeast and Southeast had  36% and the West had 33%.
Sales method showed that walk in stores are dominant channels for the success of the business as 39.6% of the revenue came through In-store customers, though the number of transactions done online were the highest and was about 2.8times that of In-store, the revenue from In-store was $100,000,000 more than that generated from online sales. The profit element also saw In-store as bestmost performer where 38% of total profit was derived and outlet contributed same 33% for both revenue and profit while online contributed 29% of the profit. All 3 channels are strong routes each bearing their weight in revenue and profit generation.

The revenue took a sharp turn upwards from 182M in 2020 to 717M in 2021 a revenue almost 4x the previous year which is reflective of the covid pandemic in 2020 where most businesses saw a shrink in revenue and a surge in 2021 as businesses re-open and adopt online channels for doing business. In 2021 alone the online channel boosted revenue by over 200M contributing about 34% of revenue that year which is a significant increase from 2% in 2020. The online channel is a strong contributor to revenue and profit and the channel to focus on for positioning the business for the future.

It’s interesting to note that, the addition of Amazon to the list of retailers gave a significant boost to revenue and profit in 2021 such that their one-year period of operation on all sales channels beat Walmart operations for both years while closing in on beating Kohl's for both years.

For the period under review, Quarter 3 had the best revenue generation followed by Quarter 4. 
In 2020 West Gear was the best retailer but in 2021 Footlocker was the best though cumulatively West Gear won best performer.

# Recommendations
The sales numbers were impressive on the inclusion of Online stores and Amazon so this channel and retailer should be further explored to see the other opportunities they bring in for profitability.
The regions/states/cities  with impressive sales and profits should be further investigated to see how the 3 sales channels  would be optimized for increased profitability.
Adequate preparations should be made to take maximum advantage of bumper 3 quarter sales in identified territories to aid revenue and profits yearly.
It is also important to investigate regions/states/cities not pulling in high numbers for possible bottlenecks and pro-active measures to tackle them to improve revenue and profitability.

# Limiitations
Some retailers did not have all 3 sales channels activated at the same time, hence their lower figures performances might be a consequence of the initial observation.
It will also be required to see what the numbers look like years following the period.
